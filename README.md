## Banana ripeness detection system is an app to detect 5 categories of banana ripeness (underripe, barely ripe, ripe, very ripe, overripe) using machine learning and computer vision. This project is developed using Streamlit, MediaPipe, OpenCV, and Plotly
### NOTE: The accuracy of the machine learning can be innaccurate which can be seen in the screenshots
